<h3>Best In Show</h3>
<p>
    A movie my wife and I have loved since the first time we saw it, and we still watch it
    at least once yearly. It's a mockumentary by director Christopher Guest that centers on
    show dogs and the wacky people who own and obsess over them.

<h3>Akira</h3>
<p>A beautifully animated and psychologically mindbending anime from the 90s.</p>

<h3>Igby Goes Down</h3>
<p>
    A coming of age film starring Kieran Culkin and his navigation through life with his 
    dysfunctional family. Often compared to the book The Catcher In The Rye.
